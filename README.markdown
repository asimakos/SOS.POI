                                                SOS POI Web map


A Web map app where the user is able to see via specific icons and also search for SOS POI (points of interest) such as police stations, hospitals and other health facilities, municipalities and  fire stations into a specific geographic region. By clicking on a specific icon, additional information is gained such as phone number, fax and web portal address for futher assistance.

This app has been made via leafletjs, openstreetmap as tile map server layer and specific leafletjs plugins for search. Additionally [overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/ "") has been used in order to get POI data in json format and display them into the tile server map layer via leafletjs.
